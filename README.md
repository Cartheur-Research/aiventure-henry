# aiventure-henry

Public code repository of a second-generation implementation of aiventure-aeon is hosted inside a toy bear. This repository is the public release of this idea with routines you are free to experiment with as long as you honour the license.

## Background

Devised in 2015 as a method and means to embody [aeon](https://github.com/cartheur/aeon), this concerns a prototype expression in the form of a toy bear upcycled from an older manifestation. Production would be the creation of a new model.

## Code repository

* The 2016 behaviour routines are initatied in python and you can find them [here](/python/README.md).
